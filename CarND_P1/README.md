# Project 1 - Finding Lane Lines on the Road

The goal of this first project was to **create a simple pipeline to detect road lines** in a frame taken from a roof-mounted camera.

Being the very first project, the pipeline is necessarily very simple. No machine learning is involved - just **computer vision** and a lot of *boring manual parameter tuning*.
